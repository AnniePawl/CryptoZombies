# Contact Basics
A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications. All variables and functions belong to a contract

## What Does a Contract Look Like?
All solidity source code starts with a **"version pragma"**
    - *Version Pragma* is a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used.
    - Meant to prevent issues with future compiler versions
    ``` pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

        contract HelloWorld {

        }
